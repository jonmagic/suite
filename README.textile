h1. Suite

Suite is software for small service based businesses. The workflow in Suite is fairly simple. There are 3 ways one can approach a problem in Suite. From the client, from a ticket, or from a device. Tickets and devices are tied to clients. Clients can belong to other clients (i.e. people inside a company). The clients section is modeled after Apple Address Book. Most of my UI is modeled after the applications that ship with OSX (Address Book, Mail, iTunes).

h3. To-Do

* fix up devices window so it follows suite look
* add device listing to ticket view
* sort clients by name
* sort tickets in ALL category by Open, Scheduled, Completed
* add search to clients
* add search to devices
* add file upload functionality to tickets, clients, and devices

* extract the ui css & js so that it can be used elsewhere
* build a ui for clients to login and check on the status of their tickets/devices/history

x add ticket listing to client view
x when editing a client, add new email/phone/address buttons don't work
x when editing a client, remove existing email/phone/address buttons don't work
x create a "My Account" page where user can upload an image, change password, etc
x when you go to clients it should give something other than just a blank white page
x make it so you can open a client and send a user invite, to create technicians initially...
x build out the devices section, nothing has really been done there yet
