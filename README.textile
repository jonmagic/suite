h1. Suite

Suite is software for small service based businesses. The workflow in Suite is fairly simple. There are 3 ways one can approach a problem in Suite. From the client, from a ticket, or from a device. Tickets and devices are tied to clients. Clients can belong to other clients (i.e. people inside a company). The clients section is modeled after Apple Address Book. Most of my UI is modeled after the applications that ship with OSX (Address Book, Mail, iTunes).
